# Title slide
Good afternoon! My name is Denis and today I'm going to present some of the very recent research that I have done with Ian Renfrew at the University of East Anglia, UK, and with Thomas Spengler, here in Bergen.

# Polar lows definition
As many of you know, polar lows are commonly defined as small maritime cyclones poleward of the main polar front. By definition, they have surface winds exceeding 15 m/s. This, along with associated ocean waves, precipitation and so on, is hazardous to all sorts of maritime activity and coastal communities in the sub-Arctic seas.

They are usually concomitant with cold-air outbreaks.

# Surface conditions
The question we are trying to tackle is how sensitive polar lows are to the surface forcing from orography and sea ice. Both of them are often named as culprits for triggering mesocyclone generation.

# Motivation
However, scarcely any research have focused specifically on the role of Svalbard in mesocyclone development.
The same goes for the sea ice in the region. Even though there have been some studies...
This is an important topic right now, because of the implication. Because it is unclear how location and impact of polar lows will change in response to the warming climate and retreating sea ice.

# Model set-up
Our primary tool is UK Met Office Unified Model run with convection-resolving grid over this nested domain. Boundary conditions are supplied from the global run of the same model. The duration of each run is 48 hours.

# Polar low cases
To select relevant polar low cases that seem to spawn close to Svalbard and sea ice edge, we inspected the STARS database.
7 most interesting cases have been modelled.

# Polar low cases
This slide shows snapshots of the polar low cases.
- Sea ice varies from case to case, but as you can notice, it always has a zigzag near Svalbard, leaving a bay of open water to the west of the arhipelago.
- The synoptic situation is fairly similar, with a large-scale surface low located over the Barents Sea.
- This configuration of pressure field is favourable for strong CAOs and northerly flow in the Fram Strait and the Norwegian Sea.

# ACCACIA
In addition, we simulated a shear-line polar low observed during the ACCACIA field campaign.

# Sensitivity experiments
For each of the polar low cases, we perform 4 experiments: control (upper left), with Svalbard replaced by sea ice, with Svalbard intact and sea ice moved to the north with the edge parallel to a latitudinal circle. And finally, with both perturbations combined.

# Results: polar low tracks
This image is a bit old, but gives a gist of how sensitive polar low tracks are to the both factors combined.
As you can see, not so much, in the majority of cases, the polar low not only still develops but follows a very close trajectory compared to the blue curve.

# Vorticity structure
If we look at the vorticity structure at 950 hPa, the picture is a bit more complicated. In some cases, the vorticity bands are aligned very close together; in other (e.g., ...) they are displaced and deformed.

# STARS-72
But I guess you are tired of squinting at these 9-panel plots, so let's focus just on 2 most interesting cases.
It was spotted by Norwegian forecasters on 4 April 2007.

# STARS-72: model results
The model reproduces this polar low fairly well, although the precise location is not quite captured.
The figure in this slide shows ...

Therefore, this particular polar low seems to owe its existence to the mountains on Svalbard, because...

# STARS-72: vorticity
Let's look how this mesocyclone manifests itself in the low-troposphere vorticity.

# STARS-77
This polar low seems like another good candidate for testing our hypothesis.
It was spotted by Norwegian forecasters on 31 January 2008. So it also different from the previous case in terms of the season.
During its life cycle, the surface isobars have meridional orientation and the polar low develops in a strong flow from the North.
Another advantage is that this vortex dominates the atmospheric situation within the nested domain, making it a bit easier to analyse.

# STARS-77: vorticity contours
The vorticity filament stretches from the southern tip of Svalbard, intensifies, and eventually curls up into a cyclone.

It also seems to be more sensitive to the orography than to sea ice retreat, but in all 4 sensitivity runs the polar low still develops.

# Conclusions
Spoiler alert! ACCACIA is probably more sensitive to the sea ice...
