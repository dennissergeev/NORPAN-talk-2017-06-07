# Title slide
Good afternoon! My name is Denis and today I'm going to present some of the very recent research that I have done with Ian Renfrew at the University of East Anglia, UK, and with Thomas Spengler, here in Bergen.

# Polar lows definition
As many of you know, polar lows are commonly defined as small maritime cyclones poleward of the main polar front. By definition, they have surface winds exceeding 15 m/s. This, along with associated ocean waves, precipitation and so on, is hazardous to all sorts of maritime activity and coastal communities in the sub-Arctic seas.

They are usually concomitant with cold-air outbreaks.

# Surface conditions
The question we are trying to tackle is how sensitive polar lows are to the surface forcing from orography and sea ice. Both of them are often named as culprits for triggering mesocyclone generation.

# Motivation
However, scarcely any research have focused specifically on the role of Svalbard in mesocyclone development.
The same goes for the sea ice in the region. Even though there have been some studies...
This is an important topic right now, because of the implication. Because it is unclear how location and impact of polar lows will change in response to the warming climate and retreating sea ice.

# Model set-up
Our primary tool is UK Met Office Unified Model run with convection-resolving grid over this nested domain. Boundary conditions are supplied from the global run of the same model. The duration of each run is 48 hours.
